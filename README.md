# ANIMAL FINDER GAME APP
We are asked to develop animal finder game for children under age of 6. In this
application, we will show images of some animals on screen and ask children to click which of the
animal to be found. My application needs to talk with children because they often do not know
how to read at that ages. For instance; the application asks “Find the lion, Lion makes sound:
Roarr!” and shows images of random animals below including lion. If they click the right answer,
app will give points, and talk : “You got it” or something more appropriate for children.<br/>
Level 1: Choose correct animal from 2 animals,<br/>
Level 2: Choose correct animal from 3 animals,<br/>
Level 3: Choose correct animal from 4 animals,<br/>
Level 4: Choose correct animal from 6 animals,<br/>
Level 5: Choose correct animal from 8 animals.<br/>
Three (3) consecutive correct answer will increase level by 1. Wrong answer ends current game.
Best point in the game will be saved. Please update it appropriately when it is surpassed.
